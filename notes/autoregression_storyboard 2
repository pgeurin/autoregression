to do:
    scatter matrix broken on categorical
    make the tests all-in-one
    refactor the df.sample madness
    refactor ROC graphing: put results (y_hat y) in one place, then compare in one graph at the end. 
    fix logistic timeout error
    make a y_hat vs y comparion print on feature flag 
    remove the extra one-hot-encoder
    add flags to run/not-run each model

Done:
    X label my graphs with titles of the models
    X fix titanic categoricals
    X test percent data - seed it
    X make diagram
    X test on new datasets
    X caterogical can only handle true/false? Yep. 
    X might not work on bigger data
