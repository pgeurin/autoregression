	X add Partial Dependence Plots
	X Add autopipeline to data
	X remove empty univariate graphs, empty bc of the 2 variable case
	X (detect number of cont varables ahead of time)
	X some error in the partial depednecy plot
	X offer a random samling of the data
	X for categorical variables make PREDICTEDS VS ACTUALS A ROC curve
	make alpha relative to number of rows
	X put cleandata.py, and galgraphs.py in autoregression
	X toggle univariate
	X turn off univariate plot for binary cases
	X take the log of the bar graph errors
	X Add bootstrap to 'shaped_plot_partial_dependences' a-la 'plot_partial_dependences'
	X add boosting
	X Plot residuals
	X Decide if categorical column (non int or float) has too many categories, then drop column.
	X refactor graphing tools
	X Add 'take 10% sample first' and maybe even 1%
	O Rename: learnpy, datasci, datascipy, mechlearnpy, 
	O Spline only for ridge and lasso
	O rename library: greg (Galvanize regression)
	0 transform target categorical variable: true/false
	O add 'name' to each graph title, parameter " name='' ", say "Too many categories, autoreg can only predict between binary categorical variables. Feel free to add this feature and contribute at: http://github.com/pgeurin/autoregression/"
	O fix on <300 variables
	O find eliotts' error in scatter_matix "TypeError: numpy boolean subtract, the `-` operator, is deprecated, use the bitwise_xor, the `^` operator, or the logical_xor function instead."
	X correct violin plot labels
	O make a make test.py program - ask: how?
	O add datetime identifier: what do I do with it?
	O check standardization?
	O get subsample, THEN clean
	O add jitter
			jitter = np.random.uniform(-.05,.05,len(df_admissions.admit))
			jitter2 = np.random.uniform(-.05,.05,len(df_admissions.admit))
			fig, axs = plt.subplots(3,1, figsize=(12,12))
			axs[0].scatter(df_admissions.gpa,df_admissions.admit+jitter, s = 1)
			axs[1].scatter(df_admissions.gre+jitter2*50,df_admissions.admit+jitter, s = 1)
			axs[2].scatter(df_admissions["rank"]+jitter2,df_admissions.admit+jitter, s = 1)
			like in: http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Users/macbookpro/Dropbox/Galvanize/dsi-logistic-regression/pair.ipynb
	X turn the vioin plots 90 deg
	O add jitter like in
	X change violinplots log on y, not x.
	X fix nameing on violin plots
	O Add gridsearch to change scoring function AND test varibles
	O Plot the Train Test comparison graph AND choose the best model parameters
	O Add jitter to the compare prediction in the binary case
	X Add relative importances of DT and RF. (Significance factors)
	X Plot Lasso Regression variables
	O put partial diff eq. 2 X N (side by side)
	X Tree feature importances
	O Add nlp if there's a string of 4 or more words in 30% of a column
	O make manual setting for each variable
	O Add image processing (with that simple regression thing) if there are matrixes of equal(ish) size
	X Make barplots into violin plots
	O Make PREDICTEDS VS ACTUALS into a scatter plot for the categorical variable case
	O Add coeff bootstrap plot to continuous varible: gets "ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (32) into shape (1)" error
	O Ensemble the solutions with best LR on some new Train Data.
	O Add ability to make train/test split on newer data by date instead of CV.
	O Add kept lasso regression variables back in (how many do we keep?!) to other datasets
	O Handle predicting more than two catagories - Break multivariabes into sections, plot each one?
	O Move to spark???
	O Fix many the MANY features limit on graph?
	O if y==None: perform Clustering.
	O NLP naive_bayes on the side. (or add it in?, let that be an option,)
	O Turn cleandata functions into pipelines so we can clean separate data.
	O fix : (BECAUSE RIGHT NOW len(y) WILL NEVER EQUAL y_hat_sample, I need to take the samle sample from y)
		problem:
			df_X_sample = df.sample(sample_limit).drop(y_var_name, axis=1)
	        y_hat_sample = model.predict(df_X_sample)
	        if is_continuous:
	            if len(y)>0:
	                if len(y) == len(y_hat_sample):
	    maybe solution is :
			y_sample = y.iloc[df_X_sample.rows]
	O pickle created models for later use
	O make conda installable

	------
	X Add ability to clean data!
	X Test current regression against simple linear case
	- Trouble shoot shitty regression
		- look at coeffs
		- look at features
	Finish testing case study regression
	X add ability to handle only continous variables
	only ability to handle only categories variables
	X add ability to handle regressions
	- add ability to handle categorical results in y column
	X Make ALL THE GRAPH
	X graph the coeffs
	- make testing ability
	- detect loads of text, nlp it.
	X make graphs?
	X Remove splines from multiuse?
	X Create testing environment
	X Compare regressions
	- Handle/drop dates
	- Handle units?
	X Remove data leakage from N/A or INF results in the answers. DROP THOSE COLUMNS INSTEAD.
	- Try one data set
	- Try lasso
	- Remove standarization for y
	X need to make a separate parameter for the 1000 year old cases
	- make it's own test set
	- offer changes to plotting_tools from the changes in galgraphs: the tools are more generalized this way. (Or at least the ability to handle new cases)
Writeup:

It is well known that data scientists spend 90% of their time cleaning data. That leaves a 1.8billion dollars on the table for the one who can automatically clean a dataset.
